What did you learn? What did you know already?
I learned how to set up an Unreal Environment and what blueprints are.

What was difficult in the lab? How did you overcome it?
Nothing was particularly difficult. 

How can the lab be improved?
I don't have any criticism. 

I spent roughly 2 hours doing the lab.
